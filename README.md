# RTL Synthesis of 16-bit ALU using Yosys
The 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a fundamental digital circuit designed to perform arithmetic and logic operations on 16-bit binary numbers. It consists of various functional blocks, such as adders, logic gates, and multiplexers, integrated to execute a wide range of operations like addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and more. The design is implemented using the Verilog hardware description language and subjected to RTL simulation and synthesis using Yosys, an open-source synthesis tool.
